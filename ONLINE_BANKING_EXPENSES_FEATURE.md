## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **New Expense Categories**
Added 9 new online banking expense types:
- Bank Fees
- Expenses - Fees Online Services
- Expenses - Suppliers (Stock Expenses)
- Expense Utility Bills
- Hired Service Expenses
- Internet Bills
- Rent Expense
- Tax Authorities
- Other Expenses

### 2. **Updated Database Schema**
The MongoDB schema now includes:
- `online_banking_expenses[]` - Array to store online banking expenses
- `summary.total_cash_expenses` - Total of staff + cash expenses only
- `summary.total_online_expenses` - Total of online banking expenses
- `summary.total_all_expenses` - Combined total of all expenses

### 3. **Updated Calculation Logic**

#### **Cash Turnover** (unchanged logic)
```
Cash Turnover = Cash Revenue - Cash Expenses
```
- **Cash Revenue** = General Revenue - POS Revenue
- **Cash Expenses** = Staff Expenses + Regular Cash Expenses
- ❌ **DOES NOT include** Online Banking Expenses

#### **General Turnover** (updated logic)
```
General Turnover = General Revenue - All Expenses
```
- **All Expenses** = Cash Expenses + Online Banking Expenses
- ✅ **INCLUDES** Online Banking Expenses

## 📊 How It Works

### Example Scenario:
```
General Revenue: 5,000 BGN
POS Revenue: 2,000 BGN
Staff Expenses: 500 BGN
Cash Expenses: 800 BGN
Online Banking Expenses: 600 BGN (Rent + Utilities + Bank Fees)
```

### Calculations:
```
Cash Revenue = 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000 BGN
Total Cash Expenses = 500 + 800 = 1,300 BGN
Total All Expenses = 1,300 + 600 = 1,900 BGN

Cash Turnover = 3,000 - 1,300 = 1,700 BGN ✅
General Turnover = 5,000 - 1,900 = 3,100 BGN ✅
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **Cash Turnover** reflects actual cash in hand after cash expenses
- ✅ **General Turnover** reflects total business profitability including online expenses
- ✅ Online banking expenses don't reduce your physical cash on hand
